    <h1>Creek Vector Co-processor</h1>
  
  <p>Creek is a floating-point vector co-processor I developed in order to learn
more about computer architecture and the <a href="https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Chisel</a>
hardware description language.</p>

<p>The basic functional blocks of the co-processor are streaming floating-point
adder and multiplier units. Each of these units have four pipelined vector
lanes and operate on single-precision floating point numbers. These functional
blocks, along with a memory controller, are connected by a crossbar switch
to seven vector registers (effectively small sequential-access memories).</p>

<p>Each vector register can support simultaneous reads and writes. This allows
a higher degree of parallelism, but it becomes the programmer’s responsibility
to schedule operations in such a way that a fast writer doesn’t overwrite the
values a slow reader is trying to read (or, vice-versa, that a fast reader
does not try to read values that a slow writer has not yet updated).</p>

<p>The co-processor also does not have any control flow instructions.
Instructions are issued one after another until a special instruction which
pauses the co-processor. This instruction allows the host processor
to take back control, copy data between its memory and co-processor memory,
write new instructions, and restart the co-processor.</p>

<p>The Chisel source code, Verilog FPGA glue code, and test software for this
project is available on <a href="https://github.com/zhemao/creek">Github</a>.</p>
