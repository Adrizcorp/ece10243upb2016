    <h1>Exploring the Arrow SoCKit Part I - Blinking LEDs</h1>
  
  <p>In September, I bought one of the new <a href="http://www.arrownac.com/solutions/sockit/">Arrow SoCKits</a>.
They are development boards for the Altera Cyclone V, a system-on-chip with
an ARM processor and FPGA. Now that I’m out of school, I finally have some
time to play around with it. I’ve decided to document the things I do with
the SoCKit as a series of tutorials. Figuring out how to work with FPGA boards
can be confusing and requires poring through a bunch of vendor datasheets and
example code, so hopefully someone finds these tutorials helpful.
For these tutorials, I will assume that you have programmed before and have some
rudimentary understanding of digital electronics. If you have never programmed
before, there are literally tons of free resources online. To be honest, though,
FPGA programming and embedded systems might be a bit too challenging for
first-time programmers, so I’d recommend getting more programming experience
before coming back to these articles. If you have never studied digital
electronics, ASIC World has a pretty good <a href="http://www.asic-world.com/digital/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
I will be using the Verilog and SystemVerilog hardware description languages
for these tutorials. I don’t expect you to be familiar with either. I will
explain the syntax as I go along. All of the hardware descriptions can be
found on <a href="https://github.com/zhemao/sockit_test/tree/part1">Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>The first thing to do when trying out a new FPGA dev board is to get the LEDs
to blink back-and-forth, Knight Rider style. This is a pretty simple circuit
to create and gets you familiar with using the design tools and programming
the chip. To make things more interesting, let’s also design our circuit so
that the speed at which the LEDs sweep back-and-forth can be controlled using
the push-buttons on the board.</p>

<h2 id="installing-the-software">Installing the Software</h2>

<p>For programming the FPGA, you will need Altera’s <a href="http://www.altera.com/products/software/quartus-ii/web-edition/qts-we-index.html">Quartus II Web Edition</a>
design software. There are versions for Windows and Linux. Altera officially
supports only Red Hat Enterprise Linux with their Linux version, but you can
install it on other distributions. If you are using Arch Linux like I am, there
is a pretty good article on how to install it on the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Altera_Design_Software">Arch Wiki</a>.
Those instructions may also be applicable to other distros.
When downloading the files for installation, do not download the
“Combined Files” package. It is 4.5 GB and contains some device families that
you will not need. Instead, go to the “Individual Files” section and download
“Quartus II Software”, “ModelSim-Altera Edition”, and “Cyclone V device support”.
This should give you files named like “QuartusSetupWeb-<em>w.x.y.z</em>.run”,
“ModelSimSetup-<em>w.x.y.z</em>.run”, and “cyclonev-<em>w.x.y.z</em>.qdz”. Change the .run
files to be executable and then run the “QuartusSetupWeb-<em>w.x.y.z</em>.run” file.
Follow the installation instructions given.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-project">Creating the Project</h2>

<p>Start Quartus and click on the big button labeled “New Project Wizard”.
On the first screen, enter the directory you’d like to put the project files
in (you’ll probably want to create a new directory for this). Give your project
a name (I called mine “sockit_test”). Skip page 2, as you have no files to add.
On page 3, set the device family to Cyclone V and choose 5CSXFC6D6F31C8 as the
specific device. On page 4, pick ModelSim-Altera as the Simulation tools and
choose “SystemVerilog HDL” as the format. This is not important for this part,
since you won’t be doing simulation just yet, but it will come in handy later.
Once you get to page 5, you can press Finish.</p>

<h2 id="top-level-file-and-pin-assignment">Top-Level File and Pin Assignment</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve created the project, you can set up the top-level file and
assign the pins you need to it. In Quartus, create a Verilog file by clicking
“File” -&gt; “New” -&gt; “Verilog HDL file”. Save the file with the same name as your
project (so if you called your project “sockit_test”, save it as “sockit_test.v”.
I recommend putting your HDL files in a separate subdirectory in your project
folder called “rtl”.</p>

<p>Put the following Verilog code in “sockit_test.v”.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="n">sockit_test</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="k">input</span> <span class="no">CLOCK_50</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="k">input</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mh">3</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mh">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="no">KEY</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="k">output</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mh">3</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mh">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="no">LED</span>
<span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">endmodule</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If you’re not familiar with Verilog, a “module” is a hardware block. In this
code, we are simply specifying what the inputs and outputs of the block are.
For the top-level module, the inputs and outputs are the pins of the FPGA.
For our example, we only need the 4 push button keys, 4 LEDs, and the 50 MHz
clock. You can assign the pins on the FPGA to your inputs and outputs by going
to “Assignments” -&gt; “Pin Planner” and entering in the following assignments.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Node Name</th>
      <th>Location</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>CLOCK_50</td>
      <td>PIN_K14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>KEY[3]</td>
      <td>PIN_AD11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>KEY[2]</td>
      <td>PIN_AD9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>KEY[1]</td>
      <td>PIN_AE12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>KEY[0]</td>
      <td>PIN_AE9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LED[3]</td>
      <td>PIN_AD7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LED[2]</td>
      <td>PIN_AE11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LED[1]</td>
      <td>PIN_AD10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LED[0]</td>
      <td>PIN_AF10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="controlling-the-leds">Controlling the LEDs</h2>

<p>Now that the pins have been assigned, you can start putting together the
different modules to make the circuit work. The first module we will make
is the one driving the LEDs. We will call it “blinker.v”.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p><span class="alert">Warning!</span>
To everyone reading this who is primarily a "software person" and does not
have much experience with digital logic, take heed that though Verilog looks
superficially like software code with its "case" and "if" statements, it is
actually describing hardware blocks. One particular difference is that there
is no concept of order in Verilog. Statements on subsequent lines are all
"running" at the same time. To give an "ordering" to computation, you must
explicitly design state machines as the previous code does. If you don't keep
these things in mind, you might end up writing completely valid Verilog that
is impossible to synthesize.</p>
<p>And now back to our regularly scheduled blog post ...</p>
</div>

<p>The first part of this module should look familiar to you. I am stating that
this module takes as input a clock <code>clk</code>, a four-bit <code>delay</code> signal
(we treat it as a 4-bit unsigned integer), a <code>reset</code> signal, and a <code>pause</code>
signal. The <code>reset</code> and <code>pause</code> signals correspond to two of the push buttons
on the board. The output is the 4-bit led output. I have declared this as <code>reg</code>,
which stands for register. Verilog requires you to declare as <code>reg</code> anything
that could hold state. It turns out that the output won’t actually hold any
state, but the Verilog compiler is not clever enough to figure this out.
If this confuses you, don’t worry. It will make more sense once I explain
the <code>always</code> blocks.</p>

<p>The second part of the module are some internal registers <code>count</code>, <code>pos</code>, and
<code>running</code>, which are initialized to 0, 0, and 1, respectively. These registers
actually will hold state, unlike the output <code>led</code> register.</p>

<p>The third part of the module are the <code>always</code> blocks. These constructs tell
our hardware to perform some operation whenever the signals in the sensitivity
list (the stuff inside the parenthesis after the <code>@</code> sign) change.
In the first <code>always</code> block, the sensitivity list is the signal <code>pos</code>,
so the operations inside the <code>always</code> block will occur whenever <code>pos</code> changes.
Inside this <code>always</code> block is a <code>case</code> statement that maps certain values of
pos to certain values of <code>led</code>. You will notice that in everything except the
default case, exactly one bit in <code>led</code> is high, corresponding to a lit led.
With increasing <code>pos</code>, the lit led goes to the left and then back to the right.
Since every possible case of pos has been covered, this <code>always</code> block functions
as a combinational circuit. If we had left out a case (say, by getting rid of
the default case), the compiler would warn us about inferring a latch. That is,
if <code>pos</code> happened to be in a case where the behavior was unspecified, the
value of <code>led</code> would keeps its previous value. You can see now why <code>led</code> had
to be declared a register even though it isn’t one.</p>

<p>The second <code>always</code> block contains in its sensitivity list, <code>posedge clk</code>.
This means that the <code>always</code> block is triggered by the rising edge of <code>clk</code>.
Inside the <code>always</code> block is a large nested if statement. Here, we state what
values each of the internal registers will take at each cycle. If <code>reset</code> is
triggered, we change <code>count</code>, <code>pos</code>, and <code>running</code> back to their original values.
If <code>pause</code> is triggered, we toggle the value of <code>running</code>. If we are running,
then we are under normal operation, during which we want to regularly increment
<code>pos</code> until it reaches 5, at which point we wrap around back to 0. However, we
want the incrementing of <code>pos</code> to happen slowly at a controlled speed.
We accomplish by initially setting the <code>count</code> variable to the value of <code>delay</code> 
multiplied by 2<sup>20</sup>, decrementing until it reaches 0, and then
resetting it. The value of <code>pos</code> is then only updated when <code>delay</code> is reset.
There is no logic specified for when <code>running</code> is false, so in that case all</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-delay">Setting the delay</h2>

<p>So how do we set the <code>delay</code> variable that the <code>blinker</code> module needs?
We’ll have to create a different module. Call it “delay_ctrl.v”.</p>

<p>This module takes as input the clock, two control signals <code>faster</code> and <code>slower</code>,
as well as a <code>reset</code> signal. The control signals correspond to push buttons.
The output is the 4-bit <code>delay</code> which will feed into the blinker.
We declare an internal register <code>delay_intern</code> and initialize it to 8,
which is the halfway point. This internal register is then assigned to
the <code>delay</code> output. In our positive-edge triggered <code>always</code> block, we first
check to see if a reset is triggered, in which case we set <code>delay_intern</code> back
to 8. If <code>faster</code> is pressed, we reduce the delay. If <code>slower</code> is pressed we
increase it. If none of the control signals are high, we maintain state.</p>

<h2 id="handling-the-buttons">Handling the Buttons</h2>

<p>In our previous two modules, we assumed that our control signals would be high
for exactly one cycle after the keys are pressed. Given the speed of the human
finger, this would obviously be impossible if the control signals were tied
directly to the keys. Therefore, we need a unit to detect when each key is
pressed and set the corresponding control signal high for one cycle.
We will call it “oneshot.v”.</p>

<p>Here, <code>edge_sig</code> is the input from our keys and <code>level_sig</code> is the output
for our control signals. The trick here is that we keep two 4-bit registers
<code>cur_value</code> and <code>last_value</code>. On each cycle, we read the values of the keys
into <code>cur_value</code> and the previous value of <code>cur_value</code> into <code>last_value</code>.
The signals from the keys are 0 when pressed and 1 when unpressed, so we
want each bit of our output to be high when the current value is 0 and the
last value was 1, which is what the <code>assign</code> statement is doing.
You may think that I have mixed up the order of <code>cur_value</code> and <code>last_value</code>
in the <code>always</code> block. But actually, order does not matter when using the
non-blocking <code>&lt;=</code> assignment operator. When using <code>&lt;=</code>, the values being read
will always be the values from the previous clock cycle.</p>

<h2 id="tying-it-all-together">Tying it All Together</h2>

<p>Finally, we must tie our three components together in our top-level module.</p>

<span class="k">endmodule</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We’ve now expanded our original “sockit_test.v” to connect everything together.
We have three internal signals, <code>key_os</code>, <code>delay</code>, and <code>main_clk</code>. These signals
are marked <code>wire</code>, which is the opposite of <code>reg</code>. Our modules are tied to
these signals using “port mappings”, which are statements of the following form.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">module_name</span> <span class="n">instance_name</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">internal_signal</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">external_signal</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">internal_signal2</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">external_signal2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">);</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>module_name</code> is the name we gave to the module, and <code>instance_name</code> is the
name we give to this instance of the module. The instance name doesn’t really
matter as long as they are unique within a module. The <code>internal_signal</code> name
is just the input/output name given inside the port-mapped module.
The <code>external_signal</code> name of the wire in the outer module.</p>

<h2 id="compiling-and-programming">Compiling and Programming</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve finished our circuit, we can compile our hardware description
and program it onto the FPGA. First, though, let’s do a quick static check
to make sure we didn’t screw up somewhere. Run “Analysis and Synthesis” by
clicking on the icon with a purple triangle and blue check mark in the tool bar
(third from left in below image).
Wait for the action to complete. You can watch its progress in the “Tasks”
window at the middle left. After it’s finished, inspect the log output in the
“Messages” window at the bottom. Make sure it doesn’t have any errors or
warnings beyond “Parallel compilation is not licensed and has been disabled”.
If you do see warnings or errors, look back at your hardware descriptions and
make sure there isn’t a typo. “Analysis and Synthesis” will be useful later on
for catching syntax mistakes.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mdatABF.png" alt="Quartus Toolbar" /></p>

<p>Now that you’ve checked the descriptions, you can run a full compilation by
clicking the icon with the purple triangle (second from left in the image).
Be prepared to wait a little while.
Once the compilation is complete, a file called “sockit_test.sof” should be
generated in the “output_files” subdirectory of your project folder.
This file contains the configuration you will program into the FPGA.</p>

<p>Before you try to program the FPGA, make sure that the USB Blaster drivers
are installed correctly (check the Arch Wiki article at the top for Linux,
or <a href="http://www.altera.com/download/drivers/usb-blaster/dri-usb-blaster-vista.html">this</a>
article for Windows). Make sure you have the SoCKit connected to your computer
correctly. The USB Blaster port is the microUSB port farthest to the right
if the ports are facing toward you.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p><span class="alert">Careful!</span> Early versions of the SoCKit board
had surface-mounted microUSB ports with no reinforcement. The microUSB ports
on these boards are likely to break off if you push too hard when inserting
the USB cable. Later versions of the board came with a reinforcing metal plate
to fix this problem. If you have one of the earlier boards, be very careful
when plugging in the microUSB cable.
</p>
</div>

<p>Once you are sure the drivers are working,
open up the programmer by double-clicking on “Program Device” in the “Tasks”
window, by clicking on “Tools” -&gt; “Programmer” in the menu, or the Programmer
button in the toolbar (second from right in the above image). In the new window,
go to “Hardware Setup” and make sure “Currently selected hardware” is set to
something like “CV SoCKit”. If you cannot find this selection in the dropdown
menu, you may want to check that the board is on, the USB blaster is connected,
and the drivers are installed properly. Once you’ve selected the correct
hardware, press the “Auto Detect” button in the programmer window.
It may ask you to choose your device. Choose “5CSXFC6D6”.</p>

<p>You should now see two devices, 5CSXFC6D6F31 and SOCVHPS. The former is the
FPGA, the latter is the ARM processor. Right click on the entry for the FPGA
and select “Change File”. Pick the “sockit_test.sof” file that was generated
during compilation. Now press start, and the .sof file will be programmed onto
the FPGA. If you are successful, the SoCKit will look like the following.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Congratulations, you just programmed an FPGA! In my next post, I will take a
look at the ARM processor on the Cyclone V and how to install an operating
system on it.</p>
